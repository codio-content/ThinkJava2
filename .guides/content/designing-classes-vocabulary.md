* **class** In Chapter 1, we defined a class as a collection of related methods. Now you know that a class is also a template for a new type of object.
* **instance** A member of a class. Every object is an instance of a class.
* **instantiate** Create a new instance of a class in the computer's memory.
* **instance variable** An attribute of an object; a non-static variable defined at the class level.
* **information hiding** The practice of making instance variables `private` to limit dependencies between classes.
* **constructor** A special method that initializes the instance variables of a newly constructed object.
* **shadowing** Occurs when a local variable or parameter has the same name as an attribute.
* **client** A class that uses objects defined in another class.
* **getter** A method that returns the value of an instance variable.
* **setter** A method that assigns a value to an instance variable.
* **override** To replace a default implementation of a method, such as `toString`.
* **instance method** A non-static method that has access to `this` and the instance variables.
* **identical** References to the same object (at the same location in memory).
* **equivalent** Objects that are equal in value, as defined by the `equals` method.
