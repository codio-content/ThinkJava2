The last three chapters of this book use 2D graphics to illustrate more advanced object-oriented concepts. If you haven't yet read Appendix 20, you might want to read it now and become familiar with the `Canvas`, `Color`, and `Graphics` classes from the `java.awt` package. In this chapter, we use these classes to draw images and animations, and to run graphical simulations.
