* **selection sort** A simple sorting algorithm that searches for the smallest or largest element $n$ times.
* **merge sort** A recursive sorting algorithm that divides an array into two parts, sorts each part (using merge sort), and merges the results.
* **off-by-one** A common programming mistake that results in iterating one time too many, or too few.
* **static context** The parts of a class that run without reference to a specific instance of the class.
* **collection** A Java library class, like `ArrayList`, that represents a group of objects.
