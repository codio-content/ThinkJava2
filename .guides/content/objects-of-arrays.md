In the previous chapter, we defined a class to represent cards and used an array of `Card` objects to represent a deck. In this chapter, we take additional steps toward object-oriented programming.

First we define a class to represent a deck of cards. Then we present algorithms for shuffling and sorting decks. Finally, we introduce `ArrayList` from the Java library and use it to represent collections of cards.
