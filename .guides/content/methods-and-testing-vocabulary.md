* **void** A special return type indicating the method does not return a value.
* **invoke** To cause a method to execute. Also known as “calling” a method.
* **flow of execution** The order in which Java executes methods and statements. It may not necessarily be from top to bottom in the source file.
* **argument** A value that you provide when you call a method. This value must have the type that the method expects.
* **parameter** A piece of information that a method requires before it can run. Parameters are variables: they contain values and have types.
* **parameter passing** The process of assigning an argument value to a parameter variable.
* **local variable** A variable declared inside a method. Local variables cannot be accessed from outside their method.
* **stack diagram** A graphical representation of the variables belonging to each method. The method calls are “stacked” from top to bottom, in the flow of execution.
* **frame** In a stack diagram, a representation of the variables and parameters for a method, along with their current values.
* **scope** The area of a program where a variable can be used.
* **composition** The ability to combine simple expressions and statements into compound expressions and statements.
* **return type** The type of value a method returns.
* **return value** The value provided as the result of a method invocation.
* **temporary variable** A short-lived variable, often used for debugging.
* **incremental development** A process for creating programs by writing a few lines at a time, compiling, and testing.
* **stub** A placeholder for an incomplete method so that the class will compile.
* **scaffolding** Code that is used during program development but is not part of the final version.
