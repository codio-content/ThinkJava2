Java is an **object-oriented** language, which means that it uses objects to (1) represent data and (2) provide methods related to them. This way of organizing programs is a powerful design concept, and we will introduce it gradually throughout the remainder of the book.


An **object** is a collection of data that provides a set of methods. For example, `Scanner`, which you saw in Section 3.2, is an object that provides methods for parsing input. `System.out` and `System.in` are also objects.

Strings are objects, too. They contain characters and provide methods for manipulating character data. Other data types, like `Integer`, contain numbers and provide methods for manipulating number data. We will explore some of these methods in this chapter.
