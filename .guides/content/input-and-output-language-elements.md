At this point, we have seen nearly all of the organizational units that make up Java programs. Figure 3.2 shows how these “language elements” are related.

Java applications are typically organized into packages (like `java.io` and `java.util`) that include multiple classes (like `PrintStream` and `Scanner`). Each class defines its own methods (like `println` and `nextLine`), and each method is a sequence of statements.

Each statement performs one or more computations, depending on how many expressions it has, and each expression represents a single value to compute. For example, the assignment statement `hours = minutes / 60.0;` contains a single expression: `minutes / 60.0`.

**Tokens** are the most basic elements of a program, including numbers, variable names, operators, keywords, parentheses, braces, and semicolons. In the previous example, the tokens are `hours`, `=`, `minutes`, `/`, `60.0`, and `;` (spaces are ignored by the compiler).


Knowing this terminology is helpful, because error messages often say things like “not a statement” or “illegal start of expression” or “unexpected token”. Comparing Java to English, statements are complete sentences, expressions are phrases, and tokens are individual words and punctuation marks.

Note there is a big difference between the Java *language*, which defines the elements in Figure 3.2, and the Java *library*, which provides the built-in classes that you can import. For example, the keywords `public` and `class` are part of the Java language, but the names `PrintStream` and `Scanner` are not.

The standard edition of Java comes with *several thousand* classes you can use, which can be both exciting and intimidating. You can browse this library on Oracle's website ([https://thinkjava.org/apidoc](https://thinkjava.org/apidoc)). Interestingly, most of the Java library is written in Java.
