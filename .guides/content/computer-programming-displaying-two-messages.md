You can put as many statements as you like in the `main` method. For example, to display more than one line of output:



As this example also shows, you can put comments at the end of a line as well as on lines all by themselves.


Phrases that appear in quotation marks are called **strings**, because they contain a sequence of characters strung together in memory. Characters can be letters, numbers, punctuation marks, symbols, spaces, tabs, etc.


`System.out.println` appends a special character, called a **newline**, that moves to the beginning of the next line. If you don't want a newline at the end, you can use `print` instead of `println`:





In this example, the first statement does not add a newline, so the output appears on a single line:

```code
Goodbye, cruel world
```

Notice that there is a space at the end of the first string, which appears in the output just before the word `cruel`.
