It might not be clear at this point why you would ever need an integer object when you can just use an `int` or `long`. One advantage is the variety of methods that `Integer` and `Long` provide. But there is another reason: when you need very large integers that exceed `Long.MAX_VALUE`.


`BigInteger` is a Java class that can represent arbitrarily large integers. There is no upper bound except the limitations of memory size and processing speed. Take a minute to read the documentation, which you can find by doing a web search for “Java BigInteger”.



To use BigIntegers, you have to `import java.math.BigInteger` at the beginning of your program. There are several ways to create a BigInteger, but the simplest uses `valueOf`. The following code converts a `long` to a `BigInteger`:

```code
long x = 17;
BigInteger big = BigInteger.valueOf(x);
```

You can also create BigIntegers from strings. For example, here is a 20-digit integer that is too big to store using a `long`:

```code
String s = "12345678901234567890";
BigInteger bigger = new BigInteger(s);
```

Notice the difference in the previous two examples: you use `valueOf` to convert integers, and `new BigInteger` to convert strings.

Since BigIntegers are not primitive types, the usual math operators don't work. Instead, we have to use methods like `add`. To add two BigIntegers, we invoke `add` on one and pass the other as an argument:

```code
BigInteger a = BigInteger.valueOf(17);
BigInteger b = BigInteger.valueOf(1700000000);
BigInteger c = a.add(b);
```

Like strings, `BigInteger` objects are immutable. Methods like `add`, `multiply`, and `pow` all return new BigIntegers, rather than modify an existing one.

Internally, a `BigInteger` is implemented using an array of `int`s, similar to the way a string is implemented using an array of `char`s. Each `int` in the array stores a portion of the BigInteger. The methods of `BigInteger` traverse this array to perform addition, multiplication, etc.

For very long floating-point values, take a look at `java.math.BigDecimal`. Interestingly, `BigDecimal` objects represent floating-point numbers internally by using a `BigInteger`!
