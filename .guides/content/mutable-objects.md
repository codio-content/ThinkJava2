As you learned in the previous chapter, an *object* is a collection of data that provides a set of methods. For example, a `String` is a collection of characters that provides methods like `charAt` and `substring`.

This chapter explores two new types of objects: `Point` and `Rectangle`. You'll see how to write methods that take objects as parameters and produce objects as return values. You will also look at the source code for the Java library.
