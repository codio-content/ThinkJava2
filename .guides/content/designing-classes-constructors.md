After declaring instance variables, the next step is to define a **constructor**, which is a special method that initializes the object. The syntax for constructors is similar to that of other methods, except for the following:




* The name of the constructor is the same as the name of the class.
* Constructors have no return type (and no return value).
* The keyword `static` is omitted.



Here is an example constructor for the `Time` class:

```code
public Time() {
    this.hour = 0;
    this.minute = 0;
    this.second = 0.0;
}
```

This constructor does not take any arguments. Each line initializes an instance variable to `0` (which is midnight for a `Time` object).


The name `this` is a keyword that refers to the object we are creating. You can use `this` the same way you use the name of any other object. For example, you can read and write the instance variables of `this`, and you can pass `this` as an argument to other methods. But you do not declare `this`, and you can't make an assignment to it.

A common error when writing constructors is to put a `return` statement at the end. Like `void` methods, constructors do not return values.

To create a `Time` object, you must use the `new` operator:

```code
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Time time = new Time();
}
```


When you use `new`, Java creates the object and invokes your constructor to initialize the instance variables. When the constructor is done, `new` returns a reference to the new object. In this example, the reference gets assigned to the variable `time`, which has type `Time`. Figure 11.1 shows the result.

Beginners sometimes make the mistake of using `new` in the constructor:

```code
public Time() {
    new Time();         // StackOverflowError
    this.hour = 0;
    this.minute = 0;
    this.second = 0.0;
}
```

Doing so causes an infinite recursion, since `new` invokes the *same* constructor, which uses `new` again, which invokes the constructor again, and so on.
