Although there are debugging suggestions throughout the book, we thought it would be useful to say more in an appendix. If you are having a hard time debugging, you might want to review this appendix from time to time.

The best debugging strategy depends on what kind of error you have:



* **Compile-time errors** indicate that there is something wrong with the syntax of the program. Example: omitting the semicolon at the end of a statement.
* **Run-time errors** are produced if something goes wrong while the program is running. Example: an infinite recursion eventually causes a `StackOverflowError`.
* **Logic errors** cause the program to do the wrong thing. Example: an expression may not be evaluated in the order you expect.



The following sections are organized by error type; some techniques are useful for more than one type.
