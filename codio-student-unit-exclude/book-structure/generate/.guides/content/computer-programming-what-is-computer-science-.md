This book intentionally omits some details about the Java language (such as the other escape sequences), because our main goal is teaching you how to think like a computer scientist. Being able to understand computation is much more valuable than just learning how to write code.

If you're interested in learning more about Java itself, Oracle maintains an official set of tutorials on its website ([https://thinkjava.org/tutorial](https://thinkjava.org/tutorial)). The “Language Basics” tutorial, found under “Learning the Java Language”, is a good place to start.

One of the most interesting aspects of writing programs is deciding how to solve a particular problem, especially when there are multiple solutions. For example, there are numerous ways to sort a list of numbers, and each way has its advantages. In order to determine which way is best for a given situation, we need techniques for describing and analyzing solutions formally.


An **algorithm** is a sequence of steps that specifies how to solve a problem. Some algorithms are faster than others, and some use less space in computer memory. **Computer science** is the science of algorithms, including their discovery and analysis. As you learn to develop algorithms for problems you haven't solved before, you will learn to think like a computer scientist.


Designing algorithms and writing code is difficult and error-prone. For historical reasons, programming errors are called **bugs**, and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is called **debugging**. As you learn to debug your programs, you will develop new problem-solving skills. You will need to think creatively when unexpected errors happen.

Although it can be frustrating, debugging is an intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting part of computer science. In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues, and you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see. Thinking about how to correct programs and improve their performance sometimes even leads to the discovery of new algorithms.
