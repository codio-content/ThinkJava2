Suppose we want to draw a “Hidden Mickey”, which is an icon that represents Mickey Mouse (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Mickey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Mickey)). We can use the oval we just drew as the face, and then add two ears. To make the code more readable, let's use `Rectangle` objects to represent bounding boxes.

Here's a method that takes a `Rectangle` and invokes `fillOval`:

```code
public void boxOval(Graphics g, Rectangle bb) {
    g.fillOval(bb.x, bb.y, bb.width, bb.height);
}
```

And here's a method that draws Mickey Mouse:

```code
public void mickey(Graphics g, Rectangle bb) {
    boxOval(g, bb);

    int hx = bb.width / 2;
    int hy = bb.height / 2;
    Rectangle half = new Rectangle(bb.x, bb.y, hx, hy);

    half.translate(-hx / 2, -hy / 2);
    boxOval(g, half);

    half.translate(hx * 2, 0);
    boxOval(g, half);
}
```

The first line draws the face. The next three lines create a smaller rectangle for the ears. We `translate` the rectangle up and left for the first ear, then to the right for the second ear. The result is shown in Figure 20.3.

You can read more about `Rectangle` and `translate` in Chapter 10. See the exercises at the end of this appendix for more example drawings.
