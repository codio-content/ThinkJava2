It's generally a good idea to document each class and method, so that other programmers can understand what they do without having to read the code.


To organize the documentation into sections, Javadoc supports optional **tags** that begin with the at sign (`@`). For example, we can use `@author` and `@version` to provide information about the class:

```code
/**
 * Utility class for extracting digits from integers.
 *
 * @author Chris Mayfield
 * @version 1.0
 */
public class DigitUtil {
```


Documentation comments should begin with a **description** of the class or method, followed by the tags. These two sections are separated by a blank line (not counting the \textcolor{comment}`*`).

For methods, we can use `@param` and `@return` to provide information about parameters and return values:

```code
/**
 * Tests whether x is a single digit integer.
 *
 * @param x the integer to test
 * @return true if x has one digit, false otherwise
 */
public static boolean isSingleDigit(int x) {
```


Figure 19.2 shows part of the resulting HTML page generated by Javadoc. Notice the relationship between the Javadoc comment (in the source code) and the resulting documentation (in the HTML page).

When writing parameter comments, do not include a hyphen (`-`) after the `@param` tag. Otherwise, you will have two hyphens in the resulting HTML documentation.

Notice also that the `@return` tag should not specify the type of the method. Comments like \textcolor{comment}`@return boolean` are not useful, because you already know the return type from the method's signature.

Methods with multiple parameters should have separate `@param` tags that describe each one. Void methods should have no `@return` tag, since they do not return a value. Each tag should be on its own line in the source code.
