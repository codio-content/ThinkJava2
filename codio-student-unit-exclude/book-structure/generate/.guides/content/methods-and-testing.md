So far, we've written programs that have only one method, named `main`. In this chapter, we'll show you how to organize programs into multiple methods. We'll also take a look at the `Math` class, which provides methods for common mathematical operations. Finally, we'll discuss strategies for incrementally developing and testing your code.
