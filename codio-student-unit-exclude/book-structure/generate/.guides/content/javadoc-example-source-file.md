Now let's take a look at a more complete example. The code for this section is in the *appb* directory of *ThinkJavaCode2*. See page in section Using the Code Examples for instructions on how to download the repository.

Professional-grade source files often begin with a copyright statement. This text spans multiple lines, but it is not part of the documentation. So we use a multiline comment (`/*`) rather than a documentation comment (`/**`). Our example source file, *Convert.java*, includes the MIT License ([https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)):

\end{scriptsize}

Import statements generally follow the copyright text. After that, we can define the class itself and begin writing the documentation (`/**`):

```code
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * Methods for converting to/from the metric system.
 *
 * @author Allen Downey
 * @author Chris Mayfield
 * @version 6.1.5
 */
public class Convert {
```

A common mistake that beginners make is to put `import` statements between the documentation and the `public class` line. Doing so separates the documentation from the class itself. To avoid this issue, always make the end of the comment (the \textcolor{comment}`*/`) “touch” the word `public`.

This class has two constants and three methods. The constants are self-explanatory, so there is no need to write documentation for them:

```code
public static final double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;

public static final int IN_PER_FOOT = 12;
```

The methods, on the other hand, could use some explanation. Each documentation comment includes a description, followed by a blank line, followed by a `@param` tag for each parameter, followed by a `@return` tag:

```code
/**
 * Converts a measurement in centimeters to inches.
 *
 * @param cm length in centimeters
 * @return length in inches
 */
public static double toImperial(double cm) {
    return cm / CM_PER_INCH;
}
```

```code
/**
 * Converts a length in feet and inches to centimeters.
 *
 * @param feet how many feet
 * @param inches how many inches
 * @return length in centimeters
 */
public static double toMetric(int feet, int inches) {
    int total = feet * IN_PER_FOOT + inches;
    return total * CM_PER_INCH;
}
```

The `main` method has a similar documentation comment, except there is no `@return` tag since the method is `void`:

```code
/**
 * Tests the conversion methods.
 *
 * @param args command-line arguments
 */
public static void main(String[] args) {
    double cm, result;
    int feet, inches;
    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

    // test the Imperial conversion
    System.out.print("Exactly how many cm? ");
    cm = in.nextDouble();
    result = toImperial(cm);
    System.out.printf("That's %.2f inches\n", result);
    System.out.println();

    // test the Metric conversion
    System.out.print("Now how many feet? ");
    feet = in.nextInt();
    System.out.print("And how many inches? ");
    inches = in.nextInt();
    result = toMetric(feet, inches);
    System.out.printf("That's %.2f cm\n", result);
}
```

Here are two ways you can run the Javadoc tool on this example program:



* From the command line, go to the location for *Convert.java*. The `-d` option of `javadoc` indicates where to generate the HTML files: ```code
javadoc -d doc Convert.java
```
* From DrJava, click the **Javadoc** button on the toolbar. The IDE will then prompt you for a location to generate the HTML files.



For more examples of what you can do with Javadoc comments, see the source code of any Java library class (e.g., *Scanner.java*). Section 10.6 explains how to find the source files for the Java library on your computer.
