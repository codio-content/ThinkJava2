* **object-oriented** A way of organizing code and data into objects, rather than independent methods.
* **object** A collection of related data that comes with a set of methods that operate on the data.
* **primitive** A data type that stores a single value and provides no methods.
* **immutable** An object that, once created, cannot be modified. Strings are immutable by design.
* **wrapper class** Classes in `java.lang` that provide constants and methods for working with primitive types.
* **parse** In Chapter 2, we defined *parse* as what the compiler does to analyze a program. Now you know that it means to read a string and interpret or translate it.
* **empty array** An array with no elements and a length of zero.
* **design process** A process for determining what methods a class or program should have.
* **encapsulate** To wrap data inside an object, or to wrap statements inside a method.
* **generalize** To replace something unnecessarily specific (like a constant value) with something appropriately general (like a variable or parameter).
